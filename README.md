# AscentAcademy_SurveyForm


Survey form to gather information from the users. This could be feedback, information from customers, or data for research purposes. I have used HTML to build the structure of the survey form and to create the fields the users have to fill (name, age, gender, details of contact). CSS has done the styling. JavaScript is for tasks associated with validation such as e-mail ID and character limit.

This project has been made as a part of internship program offered by <b>@AscentAcademy</b>.
